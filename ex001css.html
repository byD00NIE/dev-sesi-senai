<h2>Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now</h2>

<p>I was looking for a job, and then I found a job
    And heaven knows I'm miserable now
    In my life
    Oh, why do I give valuable time
    To people who don't care if I live or die?...</p>

    <h2>There Is a Light That Never Goes Out</h2>
    <p>And if a double-decker bus
        Crashes into us
        To die by your side
        Is such a heavenly way to die
        And if a ten ton truck
        Kills the both of us
        To die by your side
        Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine...</p>

    <p>Oh, brother
        Sweetheart
        I'm feelin' so tired
        Really fallin' apart
        And it just don't make sense to me
        I really don't know
        Why you stick right next to me
        Wherever I go...</p>

        <h2>For The First Time</h2>
        <p>You know she won't be gone forever
            There are many times I find it feels that way
            And I'm not trying to forget her
            Just understand how I'll be feeling on that day
            
            It's just like seeing her for the first time again
            It's just like seeing her for the first time again</p>
